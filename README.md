# Bash
Collection of bash scripts I wrote to make my life easier or test myself that you may find useful.

#### BASH COMMANDS
- readid.sh (Disaplys the /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, or /etc/group files into an easy to read format)
- getip.sh (Restrieves and displays the public and private IP addresses on a computer)
