# Bash
Collection of bash scripts I wrote to make my life easier or test myself that you may find useful.

#### BASH COMMANDS
- readid.sh (Disaplys the /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, or /etc/group files into an easy to read format)
- getip.sh (Restrieves and displays the public and private IP addresses on a computer)
- pingsweep.sh (Uses fping to send an icmp request to all devices in the defined /24 subnet and returns all the IP addresses of the active pingable hosts)
- suidcheck.sh (Checks for exploitable suid bits and attempts to exploit them if they exist. Also returns cron job scripts)
- portscan.sh (Custom port scanner. Check all ports, one port, or a custom range of ports.)
